This is a project that my friend and I have worked on together. To make it easier to understand and to help us remember how everything works in the future, we added comments on every line of the code. These comments will make it simpler for us to go back and learn again if we forget something later. They also help explain the code more clearly, so we can understand it better when we need to review the project.
